Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM) screens enviably on Composite Rating, EPS Rating and RS Rating. Each is a best-possible 99, which is no small feat.

The fast-growing Manchester, N.H.-based company makes magnetic sensing and power management chips. Last year, 69% of this chipmaker's sales came from the automotive market.

Allegro stock has seen its chip content in automobiles grow as the industry moves to electric vehicles, or EVs, and adds advanced driver-assistance systems, Chief Executive Vineet Nargolwala says.

"E-mobility as a total market represents a $4 billion opportunity for Allegro," Nargolwala said. "Our content opportunity on EVs is twice that on internal combustion engine-driven vehicles, approaching $100 a vehicle."

Allegro MicroSystems has posted four straight quarters of accelerating sales growth. Its earnings growth has accelerated for the last two quarters.

ALGM stock can be found on several IBD stock lists, including the IBD 50 and Leaderboard. It's also sometimes found on the IPO Leaders and Tech Leaders stock lists. It was also featured in a recent New America column.
