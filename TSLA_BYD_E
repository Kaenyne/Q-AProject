Tesla earnings more than tripled to $2.26 a share in 2021, vs. 75 cents in 2020 and just 1 cent in 2019.

Tesla earnings rose 40% in Q4. That modestly topped analyst views, which were shaved heading into the announcement. Revenue grew 37% beating some forecasts and missing others. Both were robust gains, but the slowest in several quarters.

Tesla's gross margin slipped to 23.8% from 25.1% in Q3 and 27.4% in Q4 2022. Its automotive gross margin fell to 25.9% from 27.9% in Q3 and 30.6% a year earlier. Gross margins are expected to fall significantly in 2023 due to the sweeping  price cuts.

Tesla excludes R&D costs and service center overhead from its gross margin calculations, unlike most automakers. Tesla's overall gross margin, factoring in only the R&D, would have been 20.4% in Q4.

Tesla said it expects to produce 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, up 37% from last year. But Musk said on the conference call that the internal target is about two million.

If Tesla is able to substantially boost deliveries in 2023, the higher factory utilization should help offset some of the price-cut impact on gross margins. But if Tesla has to keep cutting prices for incremental delivery gains, that's a different story.

BYD earnings are booming again after falling in 2021 amid massive investments.

BYD Auto revenue surged 152%.

BYD's gross margin was 19% in Q4, even vs. Q3. BYD Auto gross margin was 22.8% in Q4, steady vs. Q3. That vs. 17.8% in Q2 and 16.5% vs. a year earlier.
