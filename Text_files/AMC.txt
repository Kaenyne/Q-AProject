On Feb. 28, AMC reported a fourth-quarter adjusted net loss of 14 cents per share. That well exceeded the 5-cent-per share deficit a year earlier, yet beat Wall Street's expectations for a 21-cent loss. Sales fell 15% to $990.9 million, yet topped the consensus view. That snapped a six-quarter streak of beefy top-line gains. The company noted that industry-wide box office ticket sales likely won't return to pre-Covid pandemic levels until 2024 or 2025 at the earliest.

AMC posted a full-year adjusted net loss of 69 cents a share vs. a net loss of $1.25 in 2021. The company achieved adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization expense) of $46.6 million, a vast improvement from -$291.7 million the prior year. AMC generated $57.5 million in operating cash for the fourth quarter. Available liquidity on Dec. 31 reached $843 million.

CEO and Chairman Adam Aron noted that Q4 revenue per patron of $19.98 exceeded pre-pandemic levels "thanks to rising ticket prices and the consumer's continued predilection to indulge more at our concession stands in our high-margin food and beverage business."

In late December, the company agreed to sell APE units to Antara Capital at a weighted average price of 66 cents per unit. This sale would raise $110 million. AMC aims to reduce $100 million in debt due 2026 held by Antara by swapping the notes for 91 million APE units. The company also reported it raised $162 million through the sales of its APEs and reduced total principal debt holdings by $180 million.

On Dec. 19, the cinema chain operator announced healthy box-office and food and beverage revenue during the Dec. 16-18 weekend vs. the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. AMC rode big results amid the debut of "Avatar: The Way of Water" by blockbuster director James Cameron. AMC's Odeon Cinemas saw on the Saturday during that three-day period its highest revenue for both theater admissions and food and beverage sales for a single day the entire year.

Keep in mind that blockbuster movies or TV shows don't necessarily lead to an equally sizable windfall for the theater operators.

Robert Marich, author of "Marketing to Moviegoers," told IBD that "profit excess from ticket sales of blockbuster movies goes disproportionately to Hollywood distributors, because theater percentage of ticket revenue diminishes on a percentage basis."
