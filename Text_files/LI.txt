China EV startup Li Auto (LI) carries a Composite Rating of 66, EPS Rating of 34 and RS Rating of 77. Li is expected to turn profitable on an annual basis in 2023 on the back of robust sales.Li Auto turned in an especially strong 2022 despite supply challenges. The startup grew EV sales 47%, outselling Nio. This year is off to a solid start as well.

New models like the L9 and L8 SUVs are selling well. Li Auto targets the premium market, but its L7 and L6 models will move down into the affordable luxury space.

Thus far, Li Auto does not produce a fully electric vehicle. Li specializes in "extended range" EVs, which use a small gasoline engine to increase driving range.

Li Auto has been inconsistently profitable. Analysts expect a profitable 2023, though an EV price war could be a factor.
