BYD is still the upstart vs. Tesla in terms of pure electric vehicles and premium pricing, but the "BEV" title is in sight while the price gap is narrowing. More broadly, BYD in many ways is the EV maker Tesla has claimed or aspired to be. BYD makes its own batteries and chips, and sells those batteries to third parties such as Tesla. Musk has talked about making a $25,000 Tesla; BYD makes EVs profitably at $25,000 â€” and far less.

With Tesla no longer "production constrained," it's shifting to price cuts and incentives to support demand. But it calls into question the super-bull hopes for 20 million EVs sold in 2030. Likewise, skepticism has grown about Tesla's self-driving efforts.

BYD has expanded in several big markets, with many more planned in the next few months. Its model lineup continues to expand dramatically, including big moves upscale.

Tesla may introduce its Cybertruck pickup in 2023, its first new passenger model in over three years, but with a lot of unknowns.

Tesla stock had a horrible 2022, while BYD stock fared badly too. Tesla has skyrocketed in 2023 and is setting up again. BYD is up modestly for the year but needs to retake key levels.

Both EV giants are delivering far more electric vehicles than rivals. Both have been growing fast with strong profits, though 2023 could see challenges for both.

So keep your eyes on BYD and Tesla in 2023, as well as Tesla stock vs. BYD stock.
